Linear Algebra is a large area from which we only need the following three topics

1. Vectors
2. Matrices and 
3. Systems of linear equations.


## Glimpse Ahead {#intro-linalg-glimpse-ahead}
The central topic of this course is the prediction of breeding values. Most approaches to predict breeding values require the solution of large systems of linear equations. These systems of equations are written down using vectors and matrices. Hence the three mentioned topics are important to understand at a level that they can be used as tools for the prediction of breeding values. 


## Vectors {#intro-linalg-vectors}
The material of this section is largely based on the video tutorial (https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs) from `r mrmt$add('3blue1brown2016')`. We try to give a summarized transcript of the video. The vector is the fundamental building block of linear algebra. There are three different but related concepts about what vectors are. We call them 

1. the physics perspective
2. the computer science perspective and 
3. the mathematics perspective.

The mathematics perspective tries to provide a very general concept, saying that anything can be a vector as long as, one can add two vectors or a vector can be multiplied by a factor and the result of both operations is a vector again. For what we want to use vectors for in the context of livestock breeding and genomics, the mathematics perspective is not so useful, hence we ignore it from now on.


### Physics Perspecitve {#intro-linalg-physics-perspective}
The physics perspective is that vectors are arrows with a certain **length** and a **direction** they are pointing to. As long as length and direction are the same, the arrows can be moved around and they are still the same vector. Different arrows with the same length and the same direction are called **representatives** of the same vector. Vectors that are in a flat plane are called two-dimensional. Those who are sitting in the same Euclidean space that we are all living in, are called three-dimensional.

#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/vector-physics-perspective.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/vector-physics-perspective.png")
```


### Computer Science Perspective {#intro-linalg-computer-science-perspective}
In the computer science perspective vectors are ordered list of numbers. Later we will see that vectors can also contain more general objects like strings. As an example, we assume that we are analysing carcasses and the only thing we know about a carcass is its slaughterweight (SW) and its price (P). The different carcasses can then be represented by a pair of numbers the first being the slaughterweight and the second being the price. It is important to note here, that the order of the number matters. In terms of vectors, here each carcass is represented by a two-dimensional vector.

#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/vector-cs-perspecitve.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/vector-cs-perspecitve.png")
```
 
 
### Geometric Context {#intro-linalg-geometric-context}
Some basic properties of vectors are introduced using the geometric context, that a vector is an arrow located in a certain coordinate system with its tail sitting at the origin of the coordinate system. This is a little bit different from the physics perspective (see \@ref(intro-linalg-physics-perspective)) where the arrow can sit anywhere in space. In linear algebra it is almost always the case that vectors are rooted at the origin. Once we understand the properties of vectors in the context of arrows in space, we can then translate these properties to the list-of-numbers point of view (see \@ref(intro-linalg-computer-science-perspective)) considering the coordinates of the vectors.


### Coordinate System {#intro-linalg-coordinate-system}
It is important to introduce the coordinate system, because this will be the basis of the correspondence between the two perspectives of linear algebra. For the moment, we focus on two dimensions. The horizontal line is called the x-axis and the vertical line is called the y-axis. The place where the two lines intersect is called the origin. An arbitrary length is chosen to represent $1$. The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that give instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector at the origin to its tip. The first number tells you how far to walk along the x-axis (positive numbers indicating rightward motion, negative numbers indicating leftward motion) and the second number tell you how far to walk parallel to the y-axis (positive numbers indicating upward motion, negative numbers indicating downward motion). 

```{r coordinate-system, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/coordinate-system.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/coordinate-system.png")
```


### Vector Operations {#intro-linalg-vector-operations} 
The vectors by themselves can be pretty interesting objects, but they get really useful when considering some operations that we can perform on them. Here we consider three basic operations. 

1. addition
2. multiplication by a scalar number and 
3. dot product


#### Addition {#intro-linalg-vector-addition}
Let us assume, we have two vectors $v$ and $w$. To add these two vectors, move the second one such that its tail sits at the tip of the first one. Then draw a new vector from the tail of the first one to the tip of the second one. The new vector corresponds to the sum of the two vectors (Figure \@ref(fig:vector-sum)). 

```{r vector-sum, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Addition of two vectors"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/vector-sum.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/vector-sum.png")
```

Numerically, vector addition corresponds to summing up each of the coordinates individually. Hence if we have two vectors $v$ and $w$ with their coordinates given as 

$$v = \left[\begin{array}{c} v_x \\ v_y \end{array}\right] \text{, } w = \left[\begin{array}{c} w_x \\ w_y \end{array}\right]$$

then the sum $v+w$ has coordinates

$$v+w =  \left[\begin{array}{c} v_x + w_x \\ v_y+w_y \end{array}\right]$$


#### Multiplication by a Scalar Number  {#intro-linalg-vector-scalar-multiplication}
This operation is best understood by looking at a few examples. If we take the number $2$ and multiply it by a certain vector $v$, this means that we stretch out the vector $v$ such that it is $2$ times as long as the original vector. Multiplication of a vector with positive numbers does not change the direction of the vector. Multiplying a vector $v$ with a negative number like $-0.5$ then the direction gets flipped around and then squised by $0.5$. 
 
```{r vector-scalar-multiplication, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/vector-scalar-multiplication.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/vector-scalar-multiplication.png")
```
 
The operation of multiplying a vector by a given number, like $2$ or $-0.5$ is also called **scaling** and that is the reason why in linear algebra the numbers like $2$ and $-0.5$ are called **scalar** numbers or just scalars. Numerically, stretching a vector by a given number like $2$, corresponds to multiplying each of the coordinate components by that factor $2$. For a vector $v$ with coordinate components $v_x$ and $v_y$, the vector $2v$ has coordinates $2v_x$ and $2v_y$

$$v = \left[\begin{array}{c} v_x \\ v_y \end{array}\right] \text{, }\quad 2v = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2v_x \\ 2v_y \end{array}\right]$$


#### Dot Product {#intro-linalg-dot-product}
The dot product is explained in a different video that can be seen on https://youtu.be/LyGKycYT2v0. Numerically, if you have two vectors of the same dimension, meaning two lists of numbers of the same length, e.g. $v$ and $w$ then their dot product $v \cdot w$ can be computed by pairing up all of the coordinates, multiplying these pairs together and adding the result. So the vectors

$$v = \left[\begin{array}{c} v_x \\ v_y \end{array}\right] \text{ and } w= \left[\begin{array}{c} w_x \\ w_y \end{array}\right]$$

their dot product $v \cdot w$ then is computed as 

$$v \cdot w = v_x * w_x + v_y * w_y$$

 
## Matrices {#intro-linalg-matrices}
The introduction to the topic of matrices are available from https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE and https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU. 


## Systems Of Equations {#intro-linalg-matrices}
Systems of linear equations are introduced based on `r mrmt$add('Nipp2002')` and `r mrmt$add('Searle1971')`.
