## Getting the AWS-Educate Account
Started the application for an AWS-Educate account on https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/. After a while of not having received any response, I asked back and they required a confirmation form the directory of studies from D-USYS that I really teach the course. Once I submitted that letter, I was granted the AWS-educate grant. The grant is a starter-grant that gives me about 75$ of credit.


## Launching an Instance in EC2
Following the tutorial under: https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/getting-started/. When trying to launch the instance, I get the following error

```{r aws-launch-error, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/aws-launch-error.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/aws-launch-error.png")
```


 
## Connection
The connection command is

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh -i .ssh/ethzlbgfs2019.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-173-182-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```


## Stopping the instance
On EC2 under instances, open the tab with `Actions` and change the `Instance State` to `Stop`.


## Creating small instance
A small instance is started as described above. Then docker is installed using the description at: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

```
   13  sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
   14  sudo apt-get update
   15  sudo apt-get install     apt-transport-https     ca-certificates     curl     gnupg-agent     software-properties-common
   16  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   17  sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
   18  sudo add-apt-repository    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   19     $(lsb_release -cs) \
   20     stable"
   21  sudo apt-get update
   22  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   23  apt-cache madison docker-ce
   24  sudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:19.03.2~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:19.03.2~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io
   25  sudo docker run hello-world
   26  sudo docker ps -a
   # group docker already existed ==> hence not needed 27  sudo groupadd docker
   28  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   32  exit # ==> must exit and re-login to make group changes active.
   33  docker ps -a
```

### Start rocker image

```
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name rstudio -v $HOME:/home/`whoami` -e PASSWORD=MYywgvD3k9 rocker/tidyverse
```
