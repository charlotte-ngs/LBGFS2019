# Purpose
Diagnoal elements ($(A)_{ii}$) of the numerator relation ship matrix $A$ are computed as 

$$(A)_{ii} = 1 + F_i$$

where $F_i$ corresponds to the inbreeding coefficient of animal $i$. The source of this relationship is that the variance ($var(u_i)$) of breeding value $u_i$ is computed as 

\begin{equation}
var(u_i) = (1 + F_i) * \sigma_u^2
(\#eq:varui)
\end{equation}

## Goal
The topic of this notebook is to find a genetic explanation for the relation given in \@ref(eq:varui). 


## Material
The focus will be on the material presented in `r mrmt$add('Falconer1996')`. 


# Summary
This chapter summarises a few important points about inbreeding.
