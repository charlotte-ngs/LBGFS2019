knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmdhelp::hook_convert_odg)
```


## Disclaimer
Explaining the transition from the one locus model to the infinitesimal model is difficult. Here a few attempts and experiments are shown.


## One Locus
We assume a bi-allelic locus with allele frequencies equal to $p$ and $q = 1-p$. The genotypic values for the three genotypes are


```{r}
tbl_gv <- tibble::tibble(Genotype = c("$G_1G_1$", "$G_1G_2$", "$G_2G_2$"),
                         `Genotypic Value` = c("$a$", "$d$", "$-a$"))
knitr::kable(tbl_gv)
```
